# Auto Serial Dilution
This project aims to simplify the equilibration of macromolecular crystals to new solutions, by minimizing the pipetting required.

Crystals are placed into a small reservoir and the solution in the reservoir is slowly changed over time.

The project uses an open source syringe pumping system located here:
